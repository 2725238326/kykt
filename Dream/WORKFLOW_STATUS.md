# Dream Workflow Status

Last updated: 2026-05-17 (cycle 042 closed — DEC-20260517-003 authorized 最终修订 + PDF 编译 + advisor 提交 packaging; content frozen; bottom metadata cleanup + §8.1 past-tense; references.bib 44 entries; PDF 263 KB pandoc+xelatex; cover note + submission record G3a/G3b clean; STYLE_CONTRACT v1 closed 50 rows 7 entries; proposal track (Track C, cycles 036-042) functionally closed)

## Current Phase

```text
Phase 1.5: Research Workflow Deployment
```

## Current Mode

```text
Two parallel tracks at a checkpoint:
  Track A (Dream3R v0.3 code, architecture-first mainline per DEC-20260506-001):
    server-verified on synthetic + first KITTI real-data smoke; W1-W18
    implementation present (W17-W18 tensor-contract level only); MASt3R +
    Spann3R real adapters loaded; Fast3R real path blocked on `omegaconf`
    in dream3r conda env; CUT3R / MoGe-2 / DepthAnything / Test3R remain
    deterministic fallback.
  Track B (3R-mix Chinese survey, separate workspace Dream/3R-mix/):
    18-page LaTeX manuscript; recommended deliverable
    `deliverables/3r_survey_stage_final_2026-05-15_natural.pdf`.
    **Wound down 2026-05-14 to arXiv-only route (route C, no venue
    submission)**; README rewritten as canonical entry, Typst legacy
    files marked deprecated, release checklist appended to
    NEW_CHAT_HANDOFF.md. Internal terms deliberately absent from
    manuscript surface.

No new reproduction or heavy install authorized.
No real-data training authorized.
No 3DGS renderer install authorized.
Paper writing is now a separate workstream (Track B) but still support, not
primary; Track A architecture-first mainline holds.
Frontend implementation remains delegated to Gemini CLI / designated frontend agent.
```

## Active Thesis Candidate

```text
Dream3R: Geometry-Governed State and Test-Time Reasoning for Long-Context 3R
```

Status:

```text
candidate, not final
```

## Active Workflow Decision

Deploy Dream as a markdown-first research pipeline:

```text
Source -> Mechanism -> 3R Translation -> Research Unit -> Score -> Decision -> Plan -> Implementation
```

## Canonical Agent Prompt

```text
E:\kykt\Dream\AGENT_MASTER_PROMPT.md
```

Use this prompt when handing Dream work to Codex, another agent, or a subagent.

## Canonical Frontend Handoff Prompt

```text
E:\kykt\Dream\handoff\FRONTEND_DESIGN_HANDOFF_PROMPT.md
```

Use this prompt when preparing KYKT frontend design work for Gemini CLI.

## Blocked Until User Decision

- any new reproduction, server run, model run, or heavy install
- any new checkpoint download
- C2 v0.3 server integration, model import, or any ablation beyond ABL-memory-0 without a separate DEC
- KYKT Dream page or navigation change
- Codex direct frontend implementation
- major Gemini CLI frontend redesign instruction
- final thesis selection
- deepening any single thesis branch as the default path
- reusable Codex skill packaging

## Recommended Next User Decision

Cycle 042 closeout recommendation (cycle 042 closed 2026-05-17; proposal track (Track C, cycles 036-042) functionally closed; Track A architecture-first mainline unchanged):

```text
Cycle 042 completed 最终修订 + PDF 编译 + advisor 提交 packaging
per DEC-20260517-003. Deliverables:
  - proposal_external_v1_2026-05-17.pdf (263 KB, pandoc+xelatex)
  - SUBMISSION_PACKAGE_ADVISOR_PROPOSAL_2026-05-17.md (cover note)
  - SUBMISSION_RECORD_PROPOSAL_2026-05-17.md (metadata + checklist)
  - references.bib (44 entries from Track B survey pool)
G3a/G3b vocab firewall on cover note: 0 hits. STYLE_CONTRACT v1
closed (50 rows, 7 sync log entries). Proposal track summary:
7 cycles, 9 sections, ~19300 内 + ~15000 外 字, 14 corrective
edits total, 50 vocab substitution rows.

Next admissible direction (each requires user action or DEC):

  A. User reviews PDF + cover note and provides feedback →
     revision cycle 043 if needed.

  B. User executes actual proposal submission (fills
     SUBMISSION_RECORD_PROPOSAL slots: recipient / channel /
     submitted_at).

  C. User executes Track B survey submission (packaging ready
     with SHA256 pre-filled since cycle 037).

  D. Return to Track A architecture-first mainline (W19+ /
     ablation execution / v0.4 spec delta). Each step requires
     independent DEC + F-002 server authorization.

  E. Pause and reassess.
```

Track A architecture-first remains the mainline per DEC-20260506-001. The Dream3R 开题报告 is candidate-not-final per DEC-20260501-011 — all 9 sections complete with appropriate caveats (plan-only ABL gated on F-002, 集成证据 非训练后质量, candidate timeline). Both Track B survey and Track C proposal deliverables are packaged; actual submission for both is the user's post-cycle action.

Still blocked on user approval:

- final thesis selection
- moving any finalist from L2 proxy evidence to L3 prototype code
- reproducing any candidate model
- training or fine-tuning
- downloading any new checkpoint
- changing KYKT navigation
- Codex directly editing KYKT frontend code
- packaging a reusable Codex skill
- declaring teacher-demo readiness
- discarding any non-finalist track (Cross-Modal, Active Perception)
- **showing any of the 4 demo storyboards** (Critic / Memory / Permanence / Composer; all `draft`; promotion to `approved-for-showing` requires a separate per-finalist DEC)

## Guidance File Sync Rule

When Dream creates or promotes a workflow artifact, update the relevant guidance files in the same pass. **`TASK_SNAPSHOT.md` updates first in this chain** so that a sync interrupted partway through still leaves a valid resume pointer:

- `TASK_SNAPSHOT.md` (highest-authority resume pointer; updated first; see its own "Update protocol" section for transitions)
- `AGENT_MASTER_PROMPT.md`
- `README.md`
- `WORKFLOW_STATUS.md`
- `RESEARCH_STATE.md`
- current cycle log under `cycles/`
