# Dream Task Snapshot

Last updated: 2026-05-06 (CYCLE 016 DONE + CYCLE 017 DONE: cycle 016 produced architecture spec + ablation plan + comparator map; cycle 017 produced paper draft v1 with architecture-centric framing; all design-layer deliverables complete; next = user review or training authorization)

Status: **idle** (cycles 016-017 complete; design-layer deliverables done; next cycle requires user direction)

## Why this file exists

This file is the highest-authority entry point for any Dream session — human, Codex, or another agent. It exists so that an interrupted task can be resumed cleanly, in this conversation or in a fresh one, without context loss.

Read order on session start:

1. **This file first** (`TASK_SNAPSHOT.md`)
2. Then `AGENT_MASTER_PROMPT.md` Mandatory Load Protocol (this file is item 1 of that protocol; the rest follows)
3. Then proceed per `AGENT_MASTER_PROMPT.md`

If this file's "Status" is `in_progress` or `blocked`, do NOT start new work. Resume the named task from `if_interrupted_resume_from` first.

If this file's "Last updated" timestamp is older than the latest cycle log under `cycles/`, this file is stale; trust the cycle log and update this file before doing anything else.

## Current task

```text
task_id:    cycle-016
phase:      Architecture-first mainline (markdown only; no training, no GPU, no checkpoint creation)
cycle:      016 (Dream3R architecture spec + ablation plan + comparator map; per DEC-20260506-001)
status:     done (S1-S5 all complete)
```

One-line description:

```text
Per DEC-20260506-001 (mainline architecture-first), cycle 016 produces 3
new artifacts: (S2) Dream3R architecture spec, (S3) Dream3R ablation plan,
(S4) Dream3R comparator map; followed by (S5) sync chain. S1 was the DEC
itself + feedback memory + TASK_SNAPSHOT redirect block. S2 produced
specs/SPEC-20260506-001-dream3r-architecture.md (1821 lines, 95 KB,
comprehensive v0.1 with hybrid substrate hypothesis: transformer
perception + SSM/Mamba executive memory + slot memory for Permanence +
parameter-free Composer + explicit cross-spec memory bus). 4 finalist
specs (Critic / Memory / Permanence / Composer) synthesized as 4 cores on
the bus. v2.1 contract rendered as runtime API; CR-1..CR-6 rendered as
gates; A1-A8 mapped to concrete layers (A7 / A8 are reserved hooks). All
sections carry evidence labels per Discipline rule 5. No training / no GPU
/ no checkpoint authorized; markdown only. S3 ablation plan deferred to
next sub-pass.
```

| S2 | Write Dream3R architecture spec v0.1 (NEW file; comprehensive draft synthesizing 4 finalist specs + v2.1 contract + A1-A8 actions; user-picked location specs/SPEC-20260506-001-dream3r-architecture.md; user-picked scope comprehensive v0.1; user-picked substrate hypothesis hybrid transformer + SSM + bus). Per-section evidence labels per Discipline rule 5. Markdown only; no training authorized | done | `specs/SPEC-20260506-001-dream3r-architecture.md` (1821 lines; 95 KB) |
| S3 | Write Dream3R ablation plan (NEW file; specifies which ablations falsify which architectural claims from S2; 10 ablations in 3 tiers: Tier 1 bus removal + substrate hypothesis + state-ownership isolation; Tier 2 per-module removal (Critic / Memory / Permanence / Composer); Tier 3 per-CR-rule + evidence signal subset + loss weighting; benchmark categories B1-B6; falsification summary table; dependency graph; compute budget estimate; markdown only) | done | `specs/SPEC-20260506-002-dream3r-ablation-plan.md` |

S2 deliverable summary (for resume context):

```text
specs/SPEC-20260506-001-dream3r-architecture.md sections:
  - Identity / Approval (per DEC-20260506-001; candidate per DEC-501-004)
  - Scope of v0.1 (markdown only; no training)
  - The architectural claim (control-graph-as-architecture; what is novel
    vs what is carried from existing work)
  - Substrate hypothesis (hybrid transformer + SSM/Mamba + slot + bus;
    per-substrate justification + lineage + evidence labels)
  - Top-level architecture (ASCII block diagram)
  - Tokens (T1 frame / T2 pointmap / T3 evidence / T4 regime / T5 anchor +
    object slot / T6 bus)
  - State ownership (which module owns which state; cross-module reads
    are read-only)
  - Computational cores (C1 Perceiver transformer / C2 Memory SSM / C3
    Permanence slot / C4 Critic small head / C5 Composer table join /
    C6 Memory Bus)
  - The Memory Bus as runtime API (publish + read + handoff + gates)
  - A1-A8 mapping to concrete layers (A7 / A8 are RESERVED hooks; not
    designed in v0.1)
  - Read-write protocol per window (8-step bus tick)
  - Conflict resolution as architectural elements (CR-1..CR-6 as gates /
    masks / invariants / ledgers)
  - Training-objective sketch (NOT a training authorization; INPUT to S3
    ablation plan)
  - Module-level evidence labels (aggregate distribution: ~5 paper-proven
    / ~5 paper-derived / ~10 inferred / ~7 architecture-novel / 2
    speculative)
  - Comparator quick map (lightweight; full at S4)
  - Per-spec cross-reference (each finalist spec re-mapped to architecture)
  - Risks (R1 substrate falsification / R2 bus-as-novelty collapse / R3
    state-ownership invariant under training / R4 A7/A8 reserved hook
    conflict / R5 storytelling-vs-measurement asymmetry / R6 KYKT scope
    creep / R7 paper writing risk)
  - Boundaries (13 explicit boundaries; all carried from prior cycles +
    DEC-20260506-001)
  - Linked artifacts (decisions, finalist specs as INPUTS, paradigm
    artifacts, planning artifacts, failure modes, KYKT artifacts as
    future evidence anchors, storyboards remain `draft`, paper Phase 2
    now SUPPORT)
  - Next step (cycle 016 S3 ablation plan)
  - Open questions for next session (Q1 substrate ablation priority / Q2
    bus falsifying experiment design / Q3 A7/A8 concretization timing /
    Q4 v0.1 -> v0.2 trigger / Q5 KYKT integration for evidence anchoring
    / Q6 paper integration path)
  - Discipline notes
  - Version history

## If interrupted, resume from

If a new agent or new conversation is picking this up cold:

```text
1. Read this file (you are here).
2. Read decisions/DEC-20260506-001-mainline-architecture-first.md
   FIRST — this is the most recent strategic decision and it
   redefines the project mainline. Without reading it, you'll
   inherit the wrong inference (framework-first) and propose work
   in the wrong direction.
3. Read C:\Users\27252\.claude\projects\e--kykt\memory\
   feedback_dream_mainline_architecture_first.md for the
   cross-session feedback memory restating the same redirect.
   Plus C:\Users\27252\.claude\projects\e--kykt\memory\
   feedback_kykt_server_topology.md for F-002 server topology
   (still load-bearing if cycle 015 G_run is ever resumed).
4. Read specs/SPEC-20260506-001-dream3r-architecture.md (the
   cycle 016 S2 deliverable, 1821 lines; section TOC is inlined
   in this snapshot's S2 deliverable summary above). Read this
   BEFORE drafting S3 (ablation plan) so the ablation plan
   targets the right architectural claims.
5. Read cycles/CYCLE-20260505-006.md "S6..S10 hold" only if
   cycle 015 G_run is being resumed (otherwise skip; the L3
   infrastructure remains a future evidence anchor for v0.1's
   Critic A4 head but is not the cycle 016 critical path).
6. Read decisions/DEC-20260505-005-cycle-015-launch-critic-l3-pilot.md
   only if cycle 015 G_run is being resumed (otherwise skip).

Project state at this snapshot:
   Cycle 015 PAUSED at S9 done (NOT closed; NOT abandoned;
                                infrastructure is reusable as
                                future Critic A4 evidence anchor).
   Cycle 016 IN PROGRESS:
                                S1 done (DEC-20260506-001 + memory +

                                  sync files pending)

Mainline redirect summary:
   - Old implicit framing: framework-first paper output.
   - New explicit framing: architecture-first; Dream3R architecture
     spec is the PRIMARY output; paper is SUPPORT.
   - Cycle 015 L3 measurement work is SUPPORT / prereq for the
     architecture spec, NOT mainline.
   - Train-first remains deferred / blocked.
   - DEC-501-004 (Dream3R candidate-not-final) and DEC-504-002
     (no-all-in) still in force.

Resume action when user returns:
   Primary path: cycle 016 is nearly complete. S5 sync chain
     is in progress (TASK_SNAPSHOT updated; remaining: cycle log,
     decision registry, other sync files). Once S5 finishes,
     cycle 016 closes.

   Candidate next actions after cycle 016 closes:
     - Review S2 architecture spec + S3 ablation plan + S4
       comparator map (user can read all three and give feedback)
     - v0.2 architecture spec revision (if review or ablation
       plan surfaces substrate/bus/module issues)
     - Paper rewrite to feature Dream3R architecture as central
       claim (per architecture spec Q6)
     - Resume cycle 015 G_run for measured Critic A4 evidence
       (per architecture spec Q5)
     - A7 Cross-Modal / A8 Active Perception spec drafting
       (per architecture spec Q3)
     - Training authorization (requires separate DEC)

   S2 spec Q1..Q6 resolution status:
     Q1 substrate ablation priority -> RESOLVED in S3 ablation
        plan: hybrid first; SSM-only second; transformer-only
        third. ABL-2 in SPEC-20260506-002 specifies all three.
     Q2 adversarial vs natural CR-rule triggering -> RESOLVED
        in S3: both (B1-B5 for performance, B6 for CR-rule
        firing verification).
     Q3..Q6 -> still open; surface during user review of cycle
        016 deliverables.
   Do NOT execute anything beyond markdown drafting without
   explicit user `Go`. Do NOT propose training. Do NOT propose
   thesis finalization. Do NOT promote any of the 4 storyboards
   past `draft`.

Hard rules still in force (verbatim from S2 spec Boundaries):
   - All 4 finalist demo storyboards (STORY-20260505-001..004)
     remain markdown `draft`. Do NOT promote any to `approved-for-
     showing` without a separate DEC.
   - Do NOT start any non-Critic L3 pilot (Memory / Permanence /
     Composer L3) / training / KYKT navigation change / frontend
     implementation without explicit user approval per
     AGENT_MASTER_PROMPT.md section 6.
   - Cycle 015 has narrow exceptions ONLY for the Critic L3 pilot
     scope; everything else stays gated.
   - DEC-20260506-001 authorizes architecture-spec DESIGN +
     ablation PLANNING; NOT training, NOT GPU runs, NOT checkpoint
     creation.
   - v0.1 spec carries 13 explicit boundaries in its "Boundaries"
     section; all in force.

Honor F-001 working rules throughout: do not Read large files
already cited in this snapshot; prefer Grep -n + Edit over full-
file Read + Write; cap large files in active context at <=2
simultaneously. Honor F-002: KYKT 3R model work runs server-side;
default to ssh + reuse before installing; check ssh_runner.py:22-44
ServerConfig before asking for SSH details.
```

If this snapshot's Status is `idle`, both cycle 015 (Critic L3 measurement) and cycle 016 (Dream3R architecture spec drafting) are closed; the next live phase requires a separate user direction.

                                       no L2 evidence; picking now would
                                       violate Discipline rule 5
                                       (Honesty Override) by selecting on
                                       partial portfolio coverage. Re-

                                       (see corrected entry in section 3
                                       above). User asked "这个啥意思"
                                       triggered the correction.

After  cycle 013: unchanged. EXP-20260505-004 inventories the closure
                  path (multi-regime workload; 3+ backbones; measured
                  route_regret) but cycle 013 did NOT execute it.
Closure remains gated on L3 prototype OR KYKT runner log access; both
require separate user authorization.
```

New tracking goal G7 introduced cycle 013:

```text
G7 (paper-related-work-prose-readiness):
  Status after cycle 013: inferred-with-prose-draft-anchor.
  Sections 1-7 of literature/PAPER_RELATED_WORK_SKELETON.md are prose;
  Sections 8-9 are drafted as prose. The cycle-009 case-card-gate that
  blocked prose drafting is lifted (cleared by cycle 010-012 case-card
  + storyboard portfolio).
  Closure: full Phase-2 paper writing (intro / methods / results /
  discussion). Gated on user direction on venue / length / scope.

2. Per-step micro gates (D5')        -> 5 gates, each a separate
                                        user go in active conversation:
                                        G_clone, G_install, G_download,
                                        G_run, G_log_use. DEC-005 alone
                                        does NOT authorize any of these
                                        steps; each surfaces individually
                                        with proposed path / repos /
                                        checkpoints / hard-case input
                                        before execution.
3. v2.1 -> v2.2 candidates (D5'')    -> NO revision in cycle 015. Both
                                        cycle-011 deferred candidates
                                        (8x8 grid partition; identity_
                                        consistency threshold pinning)
                                        remain deferred. VGGT capability-
                                        card gap remains per-card
                                        (CASE-20260505-COMPOSER-05),
                                        not contract-level.
4. Composer second-pilot precondition (D5''') -> unchanged from
                                        L3_PILOT_SELECTION.md: VGGT row
                                        must be included or explicitly
                                        excluded with reason before any
                                        Composer route_regret sweep is
                                        frozen. Cycle 015 does not act on
                                        this; Composer pilot is OUT of
                                        cycle 015 scope.
5. Blocked items unchanged from cycle 014 closeout, with one tightening:
   the cycle-015 authorization is Critic-L3-only. Memory / Permanence /
   Composer L3 prototypes remain blocked. Final thesis selection,
   reproduction (in the sense of paper-result re-runs), training,
   KYKT navigation change, frontend implementation, reusable Codex
   skill packaging, retiring any non-finalist track, declaring
   teacher-demo readiness, and showing any of the 4 demo storyboards
   all remain blocked.
```

Cycle 015 G2 / G6 / G7 status update at launch:

                            does NOT close G2; G2 closure remains
                            gated on multi-regime measured
                            route_regret OR KYKT runner log access.

Cycle 016 mainline redirect (locked 2026-05-06 from user message "所以现在我们做的和新模型有啥关系？或者说什么时候能开始推进主线了？" + selection of "B. Architecture-first" from a 3-option strategic question; recorded in `decisions/DEC-20260506-001-mainline-architecture-first.md`):

```text
1. Mainline definition (D6)         -> Dream's mainline is
                                       **architecture-first**: design a
                                       new 3R architecture (transformer
                                       / SSM / state-space / hybrid) as
                                       a markdown spec + ablation plan
                                       + comparator map. NOT framework-
                                       first paper writing.

2. Cycle 015 posture (D6')          -> stays paused at S9 done. NOT
                                       closed. NOT abandoned. The L3
                                       infrastructure (test3r conda env
                                       on server; launch.py patch; F-002
                                       memory; 4 local shallow clones)
                                       is reusable as evidence anchor
                                       for the architecture spec's
                                       Critic-module section. G_run can
                                       be resumed later if the
                                       architecture spec needs measured
                                       evidence; until then, no G_run.

3. Paper Phase 2 blueprint (D6'')   -> demoted from primary output to
                                       SUPPORT artifact. Still useful
                                       (control-graph theory becomes
                                       the THEORY behind the
                                       architecture); but the
                                       architecture spec is the
                                       PRIMARY output of the project.

4. Past decisions still in force (D6''') -> DEC-20260501-004 (Dream3R
                                       candidate-not-final) and
                                       DEC-20260504-002 (no-all-in any
                                       single finalist) both still
                                       apply. Architecture spec must
                                       (a) remain a candidate that can
                                       be revised/replaced/merged, and
                                       (b) preserve all 4 finalist
                                       mechanisms as composable
                                       modules, not collapse into one.

5. Train-first (option C) NOT authorized. Architecture-first
   authorizes design + ablation planning, NOT training, NOT GPU
   ablation runs, NOT checkpoint creation. Train-first remains
   deferred / blocked.

6. Blocked items unchanged from prior cycles. Hard rules carried from
   AGENT_MASTER_PROMPT.md section 6 unchanged: no reproduction / no
   checkpoint download / no training / no KYKT navigation change / no
   frontend / no thesis finalization / no retiring of any non-finalist
   track / no demo storyboard promotion past `draft`.

7. Cycle 016 launch deferred. S1 of cycle 016 = this DEC + feedback
   memory + this snapshot block (done 2026-05-06). S2..S5 (architecture
   spec draft + ablation plan + comparator map + sync chain) deferred
   to next session per user "今日进度到此为止".
```

Cycle 016 G2 / G6 / G7 status update at redirect:

```text
G2 (route_regret closure):  unchanged. Architecture spec drafting does
                            NOT close G2 (still gated on measured
                            route_regret OR KYKT runner log access).
G6 (memory governance):     unchanged.
G7 (paper related-work
     prose readiness):      unchanged. Paper output is now SUPPORT,
                            not primary; G7 closure is no longer the
                            project's main milestone. The new primary
                            milestone is "Dream3R architecture spec
                            v1 draft" (call it G8 if/when formalized).
                            Whether G7 stays open vs is retired is a
                            separate cycle-016 decision.
```

## Update protocol (highest priority — always honor)

This file MUST be updated at every meaningful task transition. The transitions are:

1. **Start of a task pass**: set `Status` to `in_progress`; populate `Current task`, `Subtask board`, and `If interrupted, resume from`.
2. **Each subtask completion**: flip the row's `Status` to `done` immediately. Don't batch.
3. **Mid-task interrupt or failure**: leave `Status` as `in_progress` and the active subtask as the last non-`done` row. Add a brief "Why interrupted" note. The next session resumes from there.
4. **End of a task pass (clean)**: flip `Status` to `idle`, mark `Last completed task pass` with what just finished, clear obsolete subtasks.
5. **End of a task pass (blocked on user)**: set `Status` to `blocked`; surface the blocker in `Open user decisions`.

Updating `Last updated:` is not optional. If you update this file you stamp it.

This rule is part of the Guidance File Sync Rule chain (see `WORKFLOW_STATUS.md`). It runs **first** in that chain — TASK_SNAPSHOT.md updates before any other file in a sync pass, so an interrupted sync still leaves a valid resume pointer.

## Recent failure modes the next agent should NOT repeat

Captured here as a short list because they are easy to repeat and expensive to recover from. Full prose lives in `cycles/CYCLE-20260504-001.md` "Note On The Earlier 32 MB Failure" and `RESEARCH_STATE.md` "Note On The Earlier 32 MB Failure".

```text
F-001  32 MB request-limit failure (2026-05-04, prior session)
       cause:  cumulative context (multiple full-file Reads + edit history)
               in one window, NOT any single oversized file
       avoid:  Read with offset/limit; Grep with -n for precision; Edit
               (old_string/new_string) instead of Write (full rewrite);
               keep <=2 large state files in context simultaneously;
               cite already-drafted content from cycle log + SPINE files
               instead of re-deriving it

F-002  agent assumed local Windows execution for KYKT 3R model work
       (2026-05-05, cycle 015 S7 G_install pre-flight)
       cause:  agent probed local GPU/Python/conda and proposed creating
               a conda env on the local Windows box and pip-installing
               dust3r/mast3r/Test3R locally. Did NOT consult
               E:\kykt\WORK.md or
               E:\kykt\.omx\plans\kykt-app-backend-model-integration-plan.md,
               both of which document a canonical server-side topology:
               KYKT 3R models live on /hdd3/kykt26 on a remote server,
               reached via system ssh + scp. Existing runners
               (dust3r_runner.py, mast3r_runner.py, monst3r_runner.py,
               spann3r_runner.py, fast3r_runner.py) already provide envs
               + checkpoints for 4 of the 5 inventoried backbones.
               EXP-20260505-001 was paper-derived and did NOT anchor to
               the production runner inventory; the agent inherited the
               paper-derived framing without re-checking topology.
       avoid:  before any L3 / training / heavy-compute G_install /
               G_download / G_run gate proposal, read E:\kykt\WORK.md +
               E:\kykt\.omx\plans\kykt-app-backend-model-integration-plan.md
               first; default to SERVER-side execution; reuse existing
               runners before installing new ones; ask the user for
               SSH host / path when topology details are missing rather
               than improvising. Local Windows box = markdown + shallow
               code-reading clones + orchestration + result inspection
               only; not the model execution target.
```

Add new entries here as new failure modes are discovered. Do not delete entries; supersede via a "superseded by F-NNN" note (Discipline rule 5 Honesty Override).

## Working rules to avoid F-001 (anti-32MB request-limit)

These rules apply to every agent operating in this workspace, including humans driving an agent. Violating them is the most common cause of multi-edit pass failures.

1. Do not re-Read a file already read earlier in the same conversation. The content is still in context. Cite line numbers from the prior Read; if a slice is needed, use Read with `offset`+`limit`.
2. For lookup, prefer `Grep -n` with `-C` / `-A` / `-B` for context. Reserve full Read for files under ~300 lines OR when the whole file is genuinely needed.
3. Prefer `Edit` (old_string / new_string, diff-only payload) over `Write` (full file payload) for any file that already exists. Use `Write` only for new files.
4. Cap "large" files (>300 lines OR >20 KB) in active context at <=2 simultaneously. When starting a new sync sub-pass, treat earlier large files as evicted; rely on `TASK_SNAPSHOT.md` and the most recent cycle log summary instead of re-Reading.
5. If a single Edit's old_string / new_string would exceed ~200 lines, split into multiple smaller Edits anchored at stable section headers, not in the middle of paragraphs.
6. Sync `TASK_SNAPSHOT.md` FIRST in any Guidance File Sync Rule chain pass, so an interrupt mid-pass still leaves a valid resume pointer (this is the rule already restated in `WORKFLOW_STATUS.md` "Guidance File Sync Rule").
7. Do not run multi-file Read fan-outs in parallel just to "have everything"; pull files in only when the next concrete edit demands them.
8. If a single tool call returns "Request too large", do NOT retry with the same payload. Switch to: smaller Read window, narrower Grep, or split Edit. Record the trigger in this section's F-NNN list if it represents a new failure mode.

These rules are mandatory-equivalent to the Hard rules below, since violating them tends to lose a session's worth of work.

## Hard rules (carried from AGENT_MASTER_PROMPT.md, restated for safety)

1. No reproduction. No checkpoint download. No training. No KYKT navigation change. No frontend implementation. No thesis finalization. No retiring of any non-finalist track. None of these without explicit user approval **in the active conversation**.
2. Apply Surgical Edits (Discipline rule 3): every changed line traces to a user request, decision memo, or Sync Rule trigger.
3. Apply Honesty Override (Discipline rule 5): every mechanism claim carries an evidence label; user approval cannot be invented.
4. ID conventions are fixed: `SPEC-YYYYMMDD-NNN`, `DEC-YYYYMMDD-NNN`, `CYCLE-YYYYMMDD-NNN`, `CASE-YYYYMMDD-NNN`. Use the current session date prefix for new artifacts.
5. Sentence case headers. No em-dashes.
