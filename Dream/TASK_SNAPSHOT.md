# Dream Task Snapshot

Last updated: 2026-05-05 (cycle 014 closed: DEC-20260505-004 + CYCLE-20260505-005; paper Phase 2 blueprint added; VGGT Composer capability-card gap addendum added as CASE-20260505-COMPOSER-05; L3 pilot selection added with Critic recommended first and Composer backup; v2.1 unchanged; G2/G6 unchanged; G7 advanced to blueprint anchor but not closed; no L3 execution / clone / download / install / run authorized)

Status: **idle** (cycle 014 closed; awaiting user direction for cycle 015 OR project hold)

## Why this file exists

This file is the highest-authority entry point for any Dream session — human, Codex, or another agent. It exists so that an interrupted task can be resumed cleanly, in this conversation or in a fresh one, without context loss.

Read order on session start:

1. **This file first** (`TASK_SNAPSHOT.md`)
2. Then `AGENT_MASTER_PROMPT.md` Mandatory Load Protocol (this file is item 1 of that protocol; the rest follows)
3. Then proceed per `AGENT_MASTER_PROMPT.md`

If this file's "Status" is `in_progress` or `blocked`, do NOT start new work. Resume the named task from `if_interrupted_resume_from` first.

If this file's "Last updated" timestamp is older than the latest cycle log under `cycles/`, this file is stale; trust the cycle log and update this file before doing anything else.

## Current task

```text
task_id:    cycle-014
phase:      Phase 2 convergence prep (markdown-only; execution selection, not execution)
cycle:      014 (paper blueprint + VGGT Composer addendum + L3 pilot downselect)
status:     idle (cycle 014 closed; awaiting user direction for cycle 015 OR project hold)
```

One-line description:

```text
User said "继续" after the agent recommended a cycle-014 route:
paper blueprint, VGGT Composer capability-card gap handling, and L3
pilot downselect. Cycle 014 produced the planned markdown-only
convergence artifacts and closed cleanly. The new recommendation is:
Critic is the first L3 pilot if the user later authorizes execution;
Composer is the backup / second pilot after VGGT is included or
explicitly excluded in the route-regret sweep design. Cycle 014 did
NOT authorize L3 execution, clone, download, install, run, checkpoint
access, KYKT runner access, frontend work, storyboard showing, or final
thesis selection.
```

## If interrupted, resume from

If a new agent or new conversation is picking this up cold:

```text
1. Read this file (you are here).
2. Read cycles/CYCLE-20260505-005.md "Cycle 014 audit (S5)" and
   "Cycle 015 launch packet (deferred to user)".
3. Cycle 014 is closed; status is `idle`. The next live phase is
   cycle 015, gated on user direction OR project hold.
4. The recommended next action is to ask whether to authorize the
   narrow Critic L3 pilot described in planning/L3_PILOT_SELECTION.md.
   Do NOT execute it without a separate user-approved DEC.
5. All 4 finalist demo storyboards (STORY-20260505-001..004) remain
   markdown `draft` ONLY. Do NOT promote any to `approved-for-
   showing` without a separate DEC. Do NOT start any L3 / clone /
   download / install / run / training / KYKT navigation change /
   frontend implementation without explicit user approval per
   AGENT_MASTER_PROMPT.md section 6. The 4 L3 prerequisite briefs
   under experiments/ are inventory; filing them was NOT
   authorization to execute them.
6. Honor F-001 working rules throughout: do not Read large files
   already cited in this snapshot; prefer Grep -n + Edit over full-
   file Read + Write; cap large files in active context at <=2
   simultaneously.
```

If this snapshot's Status is `idle`, cycle 013 is fully closed and the next live phase is cycle 014 (gated on user decisions surfaced in `cycles/CYCLE-20260505-004.md` "Cycle 014 launch packet").

## Open user decisions (resolution status, 2026-05-04)

D1'-D4' were delegated to the agent by user message "D1-D4 你自己决策吧，有问题我们商讨" and locked in `decisions/DEC-20260504-003-cycle-009-launch.md`. Summary:

Items still blocked on user approval per `AGENT_MASTER_PROMPT.md` section 6 (unchanged from prior cycles): final thesis selection, reproduction, training, checkpoint download, KYKT navigation change, frontend implementation, reusable Codex skill packaging, retiring any non-finalist track, declaring teacher-demo readiness, **showing any of the 4 demo storyboards (Critic / Memory / Permanence / Composer; all remain `draft`; promotion to `approved-for-showing` requires a separate DEC per finalist)**.

Cycle 013 launch decisions (locked 2026-05-05 from user message "好了，请你做实际的研究部署吧，无论是准备工作还是调研和资料搜集等" + clarification "Phase 2 准备 + 资料调研 (推荐)" delegating to agent; recorded in `decisions/DEC-20260505-003-cycle-013-launch.md`):

Cycle 013 G2 status update:

Before cycle 013: G2 = inferred-with-real-inventory-anchor (per cycle
                       012 COMPOSER-04 KYKT-metadata-derived card).
After  cycle 013: unchanged. EXP-20260505-004 inventories the closure
                  path (multi-regime workload; 3+ backbones; measured
                  route_regret) but cycle 013 did NOT execute it.
Closure remains gated on L3 prototype OR KYKT runner log access; both
require separate user authorization.
```

New tracking goal G7 introduced cycle 013:

```text
G7 (paper-related-work-prose-readiness):
  Status after cycle 013: inferred-with-prose-draft-anchor.
  Sections 1-7 of literature/PAPER_RELATED_WORK_SKELETON.md are prose;
  Sections 8-9 are drafted as prose. The cycle-009 case-card-gate that
  blocked prose drafting is lifted (cleared by cycle 010-012 case-card
  + storyboard portfolio).
  Closure: full Phase-2 paper writing (intro / methods / results /
  discussion). Gated on user direction on venue / length / scope.

## Update protocol (highest priority — always honor)

This file MUST be updated at every meaningful task transition. The transitions are:

1. **Start of a task pass**: set `Status` to `in_progress`; populate `Current task`, `Subtask board`, and `If interrupted, resume from`.
2. **Each subtask completion**: flip the row's `Status` to `done` immediately. Don't batch.
3. **Mid-task interrupt or failure**: leave `Status` as `in_progress` and the active subtask as the last non-`done` row. Add a brief "Why interrupted" note. The next session resumes from there.
4. **End of a task pass (clean)**: flip `Status` to `idle`, mark `Last completed task pass` with what just finished, clear obsolete subtasks.
5. **End of a task pass (blocked on user)**: set `Status` to `blocked`; surface the blocker in `Open user decisions`.

Updating `Last updated:` is not optional. If you update this file you stamp it.

This rule is part of the Guidance File Sync Rule chain (see `WORKFLOW_STATUS.md`). It runs **first** in that chain — TASK_SNAPSHOT.md updates before any other file in a sync pass, so an interrupted sync still leaves a valid resume pointer.

## Recent failure modes the next agent should NOT repeat

Captured here as a short list because they are easy to repeat and expensive to recover from. Full prose lives in `cycles/CYCLE-20260504-001.md` "Note On The Earlier 32 MB Failure" and `RESEARCH_STATE.md` "Note On The Earlier 32 MB Failure".

```text
F-001  32 MB request-limit failure (2026-05-04, prior session)
       cause:  cumulative context (multiple full-file Reads + edit history)
               in one window, NOT any single oversized file
       avoid:  Read with offset/limit; Grep with -n for precision; Edit
               (old_string/new_string) instead of Write (full rewrite);
               keep <=2 large state files in context simultaneously;
               cite already-drafted content from cycle log + SPINE files
               instead of re-deriving it
```

Add new entries here as new failure modes are discovered. Do not delete entries; supersede via a "superseded by F-NNN" note (Discipline rule 5 Honesty Override).

## Working rules to avoid F-001 (anti-32MB request-limit)

These rules apply to every agent operating in this workspace, including humans driving an agent. Violating them is the most common cause of multi-edit pass failures.

1. Do not re-Read a file already read earlier in the same conversation. The content is still in context. Cite line numbers from the prior Read; if a slice is needed, use Read with `offset`+`limit`.
2. For lookup, prefer `Grep -n` with `-C` / `-A` / `-B` for context. Reserve full Read for files under ~300 lines OR when the whole file is genuinely needed.
3. Prefer `Edit` (old_string / new_string, diff-only payload) over `Write` (full file payload) for any file that already exists. Use `Write` only for new files.
4. Cap "large" files (>300 lines OR >20 KB) in active context at <=2 simultaneously. When starting a new sync sub-pass, treat earlier large files as evicted; rely on `TASK_SNAPSHOT.md` and the most recent cycle log summary instead of re-Reading.
5. If a single Edit's old_string / new_string would exceed ~200 lines, split into multiple smaller Edits anchored at stable section headers, not in the middle of paragraphs.
6. Sync `TASK_SNAPSHOT.md` FIRST in any Guidance File Sync Rule chain pass, so an interrupt mid-pass still leaves a valid resume pointer (this is the rule already restated in `WORKFLOW_STATUS.md` "Guidance File Sync Rule").
7. Do not run multi-file Read fan-outs in parallel just to "have everything"; pull files in only when the next concrete edit demands them.
8. If a single tool call returns "Request too large", do NOT retry with the same payload. Switch to: smaller Read window, narrower Grep, or split Edit. Record the trigger in this section's F-NNN list if it represents a new failure mode.

These rules are mandatory-equivalent to the Hard rules below, since violating them tends to lose a session's worth of work.

## Hard rules (carried from AGENT_MASTER_PROMPT.md, restated for safety)

1. No reproduction. No checkpoint download. No training. No KYKT navigation change. No frontend implementation. No thesis finalization. No retiring of any non-finalist track. None of these without explicit user approval **in the active conversation**.
2. Apply Surgical Edits (Discipline rule 3): every changed line traces to a user request, decision memo, or Sync Rule trigger.
3. Apply Honesty Override (Discipline rule 5): every mechanism claim carries an evidence label; user approval cannot be invented.
4. ID conventions are fixed: `SPEC-YYYYMMDD-NNN`, `DEC-YYYYMMDD-NNN`, `CYCLE-YYYYMMDD-NNN`, `CASE-YYYYMMDD-NNN`. Use the current session date prefix for new artifacts.
5. Sentence case headers. No em-dashes.
